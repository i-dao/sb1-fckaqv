## Environment Variables

The following environment variables are required for the application to function properly:

```env
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=your_stripe_publishable_key
VITE_API_URL=your_api_url
```

Make sure to create a `.env` file in the root directory with these variables before running the application.
